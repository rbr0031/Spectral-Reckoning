My first prototype for a comercial game. This code was made in 1 week for a trailer that i sent to Indie Horror Showcase to be featured in their fest. 
Unfortunately i didnt make it. But decided to start modelling and animating my first characters to make a new and better trailer and put it on steam. And work more on the code in the sequence.

Here is the prototype trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0udX0bdFvNk&ab_channel=RomeuFuchs
